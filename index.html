            <h2>College!</h2>
            <p>I went to Webster University where I got a bachelors of science in biology. I really thought I wanted to become a doctor but then I realized I didn't want to be in so much debt &#38 work more than 40 hours of a week so all the work I did in college to become a doctor seemed like a waste of time when I didn't go to medical school! I had done a lot of research during my undergrad so I figured I would try out working as a lab rat</p>

            <h2> First Big Girl Job</h2>
            <p id = 'testP'> I got a job working as a lab technician at WASHU. It was a good experience but I soon realized how much I HATE pipetting. I also realized that if I ever wanted to make enough money to get even remotely rich I would probably have to go to graduate school. I quickly realized that the field of research will also have you working more than 40 hours a week &#38 have the added bonus of getting paid very very little! So I realized that I was probably in the wrong career field &amp I probably should've majored in something completely different than biology! Undergrad was such a great use of my time!  Yay for me!</p>

            <h2> Launchcode </h2>
            <p>After I realized I was in the wrong career field I tried to look for ways to start programming. My friends who majored in computer science were getting jobs right away after college with big buck salery offers. They could also work from home! What a great field. I looked for ways to transition into tech &amp I found out about Launchcode. I applied and THANK GOD I was accepted. Here I am now learning how to code and realizing that I actually really like it! The launchcode days fly by &amp I don't mind being here for 8 hours or waking up early to come everyday.</p>
